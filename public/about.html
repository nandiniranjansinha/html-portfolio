<h2>Nandini Ranjan Sinha</h2>

<p>Passionate about Computer Science and Engineering, I am currently pursuing my B.Tech with an insatiable 
  curiosity for the logic behind every piece of code. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have captured 
  my interest, and I aspire to forge my future in this exciting field. Driven by a thirst for knowledge, I possess
  the ability to learn anything and approach every task with unwavering dedication. With a strong work ethic and
  determination, I strive to excel in all my endeavors, leveraging my capabilities to make a significant impact
  in the world of technology.</p>

<p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged in club activities, which have greatly enriched
  my personal and professional growth. Through months of dedicated effort, I proudly secured the position of
  Logistics and Sponsorship Lead at Gen-Y Events Team, a university club. This invaluable experience has 
  not only enhanced my organizational and time management skills but also empowered me to overcome my fear of
  public speaking. Being a part of this club has shaped my lifestyle and provided me with a platform to 
  develop crucial leadership qualities. I am excited to continue this journey of growth and make a lasting
  impact in both academia and extracurricular pursuits.</p>
